# monte-carlo-simulations

**Users beware...** This is a work in progress...

Scripts and configuration files for Monte Carlo simulations of EDS and
microprobe spectra using DTSA-II, penepma, and Casino. These programs
are complementary and are often used together to model a particular
multi-layered structure.

Processing of the output from penepma simulations may be aided by my
[rpenepma][https://github.com/jrminter/rpemepma] package.
