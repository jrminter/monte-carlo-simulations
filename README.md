# monte-carlo-simulations

**Users beware...** This is a work in progress...

Scripts and configuration files for Monte Carlo simulations of EDS and
microprobe spectra using DTSA-II, penepma, and Casino. These programs
are complementary and are often used together to model a particular
multi-layered structure. Because of the complementary nature of these
programs, I have organized this repository by the **system of interest**.

Processing of the output from penepma simulations may be aided by my
[rpenepma](https://github.com/jrminter/rpemepma) package.
