The density of the C coating deposited on specimens is a debated issue.

[John Fournelle](http://probesoftware.com/smf/index.php?topic=995.msg6511#msg6511) summarizes the problem well:

> Kerrick, who wrote the 'bible'? about carbon coating in American
> Mineralogist eons ago (American Mineralogist, Volume 58, pages
> 920-925, 1973, The Role of Carbon Film Thickness in Electron
> Microprobe Analysis) uses the density of the _coating_ (not 
> the graphite rod) as 1.3 g/cc. However, PfE uses 2.1 g/cc.
> Graphite is listed in the Google encyclopedia of knowledge)
> as: amorphous: 1.8â€“2.1 g/cm3; graphite: 2.267 g/cm3;
> diamond: 3.515 g/cm3.
> **Why is the Google value, maximum, of 2.1 being used?**
> For all I know, Kerrick is wrong, and Mr. Google is correct, but
> what is the proof? Is there some reference where the carbon coat

I noticed similar effects on our FEI Sirion.
