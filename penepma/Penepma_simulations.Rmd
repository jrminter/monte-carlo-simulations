# Penepma Simulation Notes

**2020-01-12 10:30 p.m.** - I have been doing some 12 hr Penepma-12
simulations because I was getting some "no detector defined"
errors from Penepma-16 simulations. I couldn't figure out
what was wrong. Trying to keep more detailed records on Penepma-12
simulations.

We had some issues this morning when we lost Internet. These simulations
should be done around 2:30 AM on 1/13/2020.

# Penepma simulation paths

## Working directories for plotting results with gnuplot

1. This has ZnO-5kV.plt and .dat files

```
C:/Users/johnr/OneDrive/Desktop/penepma12/ZnO
```

2. This has Si-5kV.plt and .dat files

```
C:/Users/johnr/OneDrive/Desktop/penepma12/Si
```

## Working directories for running penepma12 simulations


1. This is the main penepma12 sim of Si at 5 kV

```
C:/Users/johnr/Documents/work/penepma12/Si_5kV
```

2.  This is the main penepma12 sim of ZnO at 5 kV

```
C:/Users/johnr/Documents/work/penepma12/ZnO_5kV
```

## Working directories for running penepma16 simulations

1. This is a penepma16 simulation of B at 5 kV
