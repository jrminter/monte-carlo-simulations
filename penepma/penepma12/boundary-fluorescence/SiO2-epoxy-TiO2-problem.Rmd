# Introduction

This introduction comes from the Probe Software Forum [here](https://probesoftware.com/smf/index.php?topic=58.msg8146#msg8146).

Does anyone have a file of this (or similar) geometry that they can share with us?

[Phillipe Pinard](https://probesoftware.com/smf/index.php?topic=58.msg8172#msg8172)
supplied the [.geo](./inc/sio2-epoxy-tio2.geo) file. Note: I renamed the file to
make it more descriptive.

[Marisa Acosta](https://probesoftware.com/smf/index.php?topic=58.msg8176#msg8176)
asked:

[John Donovan](https://probesoftware.com/smf/index.php?topic=58.msg8177#msg8177)
clarified further:

> So converting the k-ratios to % k-ratio and applying a matrix correction

```{r makeTbale, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(here)
library(readr)
library(knitr)
fi <- here('penepma/penepma12/boundary-fluorescence/inc/jd.csv')
# print(fi)
tib <- read_tsv(fi)
kable(tib)
```

[Phillipe Pinard](https://probesoftware.com/smf/index.php?topic=58.msg8180#msg8180)
supplied the python code (He named it epoxy.py, I saveed it as sio2-epoxy-tio2.py
in the `inc` folder...)

Phillipe noted:

# Penepma-Calczaf approac

[John Donovan](https://probesoftware.com/smf/index.php?topic=58.msg8193#msg8193)

Explained how he and Marissa carefully implemented their approach:

> I thought I would share how Marisa and I manually edited the Penepma .in input
> files to work with Penepma .geo files containing three materials.  This manual
> editing is necessary because the Penepma GUI in Standard only supports one or
> two materials. This two material limitation covers most modeling situations,
> e.g., a single phase (bulk.geo), a SF boundary fluorescence (couple.geo), a
> thin file on a substrate (bilayer_200nm.geo), and an inclusion in a matrix
> (50mic_sphere.geo).
>
> The reason for not supporting more than two materials in the Standard GUI is
> that the possible configurations gets complicated, and so it was decided to
> **limit the Penepma GUI in Standard to two materials**. But we can add a third
> material to the Penepma .in input files manually using a text editor, and then
> still be able to run these input files from the Penepma GUI in Batch Mode,
> which automatically copies each completed simulation to a specified subfolder
> for subsequent review and/or k-ratio extraction.
> 
> But first let me mention that after manually modifying the Penepma .in files
> for a third material and then reloading the modified .in file into the Penepma
> GUI, we discovered a small bug that caused an error message about a missing
> control index (for the manually edited third material).  This bug still
> allowed the batch mode option to run the simulation, but one had to
> "click through" the error message for each .in file containing more than two
> materials. **The current version of the Penepma GUI in Standard (update to PFE**
> **and CalcZAF v. 12.6.0) now handles three materials for running in batch mode**.
> But please note that loading a manually edited three material .in file into the
> Penepma GUI (by using the Browse button), and re-saving that .in file, will
> cause the third material to be excluded from the saved .in file. **Bottom line:**
> don't click the Create PENEPMA Input File button if your .in file contains
> more than two materials.  Or if you do, simply re-edit the .in file afterwards,
> by adding the third material manually, as I am about to describe below.
> 
> So, let's start by looking at a three material .geo file, specifically the
> one created by Philippe Pinard for two inclusions (each a different material)
> separated by a specified distance, in a matrix (a third material).
