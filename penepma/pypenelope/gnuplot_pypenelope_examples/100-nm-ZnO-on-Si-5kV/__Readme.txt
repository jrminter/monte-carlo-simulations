These are exemplar plots from a pypenelope simulation of
100 nm ZnO on Si at 5kV

The data file for the spectrum was the .msa spectrum exported from
the gui (`Spectrum 1.msa`). The three phi rho z files are for
O, Zn, and SiO. The .plt files show how to plot these in gnuplot.

Note: this was a short (1 hr simulation).

The xml file to recreate the simulation ()and run for a longer time)
is included.
