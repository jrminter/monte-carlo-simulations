## Analysis of layers of Ir and Ag on a silica substrate

This is the system that inspired this repository. The problem was presented by
the user `Farqhuit` on the Probe Software Forum
[here](http://probesoftware.com/smf/index.php?topic=1104.0). This caught my
interest because he described the system like this:

> The thin iridium film (light area) in the map image, has a thin silver

Iridium (Z=77, density=22.56 g/cm3) is a heavy metal and can absorb X-rays.
John Armstrong has demonstrated that a 5 nm film is conductive and so thin
coatings are useful where one wants to measure C. This alerted me to the need
to do some modeling.
