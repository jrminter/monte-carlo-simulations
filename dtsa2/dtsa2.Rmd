## Some key items to remember

1. **Simulating both detected and emitted spectra** - Recently Nicholas
Ritchie updated DTSA-II Kelvin to compute both the detected and emitted
spectra. This is a really nice feature. The best way I could conceive
to do this in Python was to return a list. The major concern was that
returning a list would break existing scripts. I created as second
version of `mcSimulate3.py`, named `jmcSimulate3.py` where all the
simulation functions return a list of two spectra.

To install this functionality, add the `jmcSimulate3.py` function to
the lib directory with all the other python scripts.

For a simple example, checkout the `test-jmc3-simulate-bulk.py` script
in the `work-in-progress` folder.
